## Overview

GTM is first loaded from Google and then the various tags depend on what your specific site and what you have configured GTM to call. Each tag is then called and loaded from where that tag lives. For example, the LinkedIn tag would load into the browser from LinkedIn.com (not Google).

Tag managers are not usually directly managing content that is displayed to the user, they are generally for tags behind the scenes. A content manager is called a CMS, which is different than a TMS.
